# Text Detection Submission Guide (Deprecated)

Example code for the Text Detection Submission can be found in the `redteam_core/miner/commits/text_detection` directory. Follow the steps below to build, tag, push, and update the active commit:

## 1. Navigate to the Text Detection Commit Directory

```sh
cd redteam_core/miner/commits/text_detection
```

## 2. Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the text detection submission, run:

```sh
docker build -t text_detection_submission:0.0.1 .
```

## 3. Tag the Docker Image

After building the image, tag it with your repository name:

```sh
docker tag text_detection_submission:0.0.1 myhub/text_detection_submission:0.0.1
```

## 4. Log in to Docker

Log in to your Docker Hub account using the following command:

```sh
docker login
```

Enter your Docker Hub credentials when prompted.

## 5. Push the Docker Image

Push the tagged image to your Docker Hub repository:

```sh
docker push myhub/text_detection_submission:0.0.1
```

## 6. Retrieve the SHA256 Digest

After pushing the image, retrieve the digest by running:

```sh
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' myhub/text_detection_submission:0.0.1
```

## 7. Update active_commit.yaml

Finally, go to the `neurons/miner/active_commit.yaml` file and update it with the new image tag:

```yaml
- text_detection---myhub/text_detection_submission@<sha256:digest>
```
