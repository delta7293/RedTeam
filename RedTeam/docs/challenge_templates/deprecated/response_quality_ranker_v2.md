# Response Quality Ranker V2 Submission Guide (Active after Jan 15th 2025 14:00 UTC)

## Description

The **Response Quality Ranker V2** challenge evaluates miners on their ability to rank multiple responses to a given question based on quality, including relevance, clarity, and detail. Miners must submit models capable of ranking these responses, aligning as closely as possible to the provided ground truth rankings. This challenge is designed to foster advancements in text evaluation and ranking algorithms.

## Example Code and Submission Instructions

Example code for the Response Quality Ranker Submission can be found in the `redteam_core/miner/commits/response_quality_ranker` directory.

Download model [princeton-nlp/unsup-simcse-bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/princeton-nlp/unsup-simcse-bert-base-uncased) and place it in the `redteam_core/miner/commits/response_quality_ranker` directory.
Download model [snorkelai/instruction-response-quality](https://huggingface.co/snorkelai/instruction-response-quality), place it in the `redteam_core/miner/commits/response_quality_ranker` directory and rename to `models`.  **Remember to include all model files, as miner is prevented from connecting to the internet.**

Follow the steps below to build, tag, push, and update the active commit:

### 1. Navigate to the Response Quality Ranker Commit Directory

```sh
cd redteam_core/miner/commits/response_quality_ranker
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the text detection submission, run:

```sh
docker build -t response_quality_ranker:0.0.1 .
```

### 3. Tag the Docker Image

After building the image, tag it with your repository name:

```sh
docker tag response_quality_ranker:0.0.1 myhub/response_quality_ranker:0.0.1
```

### 4. Log in to Docker

Log in to your Docker Hub account using the following command:

```sh
docker login
```

Enter your Docker Hub credentials when prompted.

### 5. Push the Docker Image

Push the tagged image to your Docker Hub repository:

```sh
docker push myhub/response_quality_ranker:0.0.1
```

### 6. Retrieve the SHA256 Digest

After pushing the image, retrieve the digest by running:

```sh
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' myhub/response_quality_ranker:0.0.1
```

### 7. Update active_commit.yaml

Finally, go to the `neurons/miner/active_commit.yaml` file and update it with the new image tag:

```yaml
- response_quality_ranker_v2---myhub/response_quality_ranker@<sha256:digest>
```
