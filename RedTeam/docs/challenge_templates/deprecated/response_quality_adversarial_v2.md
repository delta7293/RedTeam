# Response Quality Adversarial V2 Submission Guide (Active after Jan 15th 2025 14:00 UTC)

## Description

The **Response Quality Adversarial V2** challenge focuses on testing miners' ability to generate responses that can trick a ranking model into misjudging their quality. Miners are provided with a modified question prompt and are tasked to generate responses that appear higher quality to the ranking model than they might actually be, based on the prompt's intent.

This challenge is designed to encourage creativity and strategic thinking in crafting responses, pushing models to identify and exploit weaknesses in ranking systems. It simultaneously helps improve ranking models by identifying potential adversarial strategies.

Miners should aim to develop responses that maximize their score according to the ranking model, even when the responses are not strictly aligned with the ground truth. This helps foster innovation in adversarial generation and defense techniques.

## Example Code and Submission Instructions

Example code for the Response Quality Adversarial Submission can be found in the `redteam_core/miner/commits/response_quality_adversarial` directory.

Download model [unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct) and place it in the `redteam_core/miner/commits/response_quality_adversarial` directory. **Remember to include all model files, as miner is prevented from connecting to the internet.**

Follow the steps below to build, tag, push, and update the active commit:

### 1. Navigate to the Response Quality Adversarial Commit Directory

```sh
cd redteam_core/miner/commits/response_quality_adversarial
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the text detection submission, run:

```sh
docker build -t response_quality_adversarial:0.0.1 .
```

### 3. Tag the Docker Image

After building the image, tag it with your repository name:

```sh
docker tag response_quality_adversarial:0.0.1 myhub/response_quality_adversarial:0.0.1
```

### 4. Log in to Docker

Log in to your Docker Hub account using the following command:

```sh
docker login
```

Enter your Docker Hub credentials when prompted.

### 5. Push the Docker Image

Push the tagged image to your Docker Hub repository:

```sh
docker push myhub/response_quality_adversarial:0.0.1
```

### 6. Retrieve the SHA256 Digest

After pushing the image, retrieve the digest by running:

```sh
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' myhub/response_quality_adversarial:0.0.1
```

### 7. Update active_commit.yaml

Finally, go to the `neurons/miner/active_commit.yaml` file and update it with the new image tag:

```yaml
- response_quality_adversarial_v2---myhub/response_quality_adversarial@<sha256:digest>
```
