# Submission Guide

## Step 1: Create an `app.py`

Ensure your API server includes the following two routes:

### 1. `/health` Route

- **Method**: `GET`
- **Response**: Return a JSON object with the following structure:

    ```json
    {
        "status": "ok"
    }
    ```

### 2. `/solve` Route

- **Method**: `POST`
- **Input**: Receives a `MinerInput` object. This object represents the challenge sent by the validator.
- **Output**: Returns a `MinerOutput` object. This object contains your response to the challenge.

Both `MinerInput` and `MinerOutput` are defined in:
`readteam_core/challenge_pool/<challenge_name>/data_types.py`

## Step 2: Package Your Submission Using Docker

To package your submission using Docker, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a `requirements.txt` file

Make sure to include a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory with all necessary dependencies for your project. For example:

```text
fastapi
uvicorn
transformers
accelerate
```

You can generate a `requirements.txt` file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` if you have a virtual environment set up.

### 2. Create a `Dockerfile`

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project to define the container image. Below is an example template for the `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
# Use a base image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy all necessary files into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on (must be 10002)
EXPOSE 10002

# Run the app using the command (adjust accordingly if using Flask or FastAPI)
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "10002"]
```

### 3. Build and Test Your Docker Image

After creating the `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt`, you can build, tag your Docker image and push it to Docker Hub. Refer to the documentation for [Docker](./5.docker.md).

You can view the tutorial for text detection submission [here](./challenge_templates/deprecated/text_detection.md).
